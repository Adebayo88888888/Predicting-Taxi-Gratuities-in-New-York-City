    "  What are the ethical implications of the model? What are the consequences of our model making errors?\n",

    "**Answer:**\n",
    "Drivers who didn't receive tips will probably be upset that the app told them a customer would leave a tip. If it happened often, drivers might not trust the app.\n",
    "Drivers are unlikely to pick up people who are predicted to not leave tips. Customers will have difficulty finding a taxi that will pick them up, and might get angry at the taxi company. Even when the model is correct, people who can't afford to tip will find it more difficult to get taxis, which limits the accessibility of taxi service to those who pay extra.\n",
    "\n",

    "   Do the benefits of such a model outweigh the potential problems?\n",
    "   \n",

    "   Should we proceed with the request to build this model? Why or why not?\n",

    "The model is twice as likely to predict a false negative than it is to predict a false positive. Therefore, type II errors are more common. For our use case, this would be more desirable, because it's better for a driver to be pleasantly surprised by a generous tip when they weren't expecting one than to be disappointed by a low tip when they were expecting a generous one. However, it's unlikely that this model would be deployed without further development to significantly improve its performance."

    "In this step, we will use the results of the models above to formulate a conclusion. Considering the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Would we recommend using this model? Why or why not?**  \n",
    "This is not a great model, but depending on how it's used it could still be useful. If the objective is only to help give taxi drivers a better idea of whether someone will leave a good tip, then it could be useful. It may be worthwhile to test it with a select group of taxi drivers to get feedback.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **What was the highest scoring model?**   \n",
    "Unfortunately, XGBoost is not the most transparent machine learning algorithm. We know that `predicted_fare`, `mean_duration`, and `mean_distance` are the most important features, but we don't know how they influence tipping. This would require further exploration.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Are there new features that we can engineer that might improve model performance?**   \n",
    "In our case, we could try creating three new columns that indicate if the trip distance is short, medium, or far.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **What features would we want to have that would likely improve the performance of the model?**   \n",
    "It would probably be very helpful to have past tipping behavior for each customer. It would also be valuable to have accurate tip values for customers who pay with cash.\n",
    "It would be helpful to have a lot more data. With enough data, we could create a unique feature for each pickup/dropoff combination."
